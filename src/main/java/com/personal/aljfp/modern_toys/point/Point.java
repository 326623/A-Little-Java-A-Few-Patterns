  2.

/*

    1. Point is a data type, basically a Pair of numbers
    2. x and y are coordinates
    3. CartesianPt and ManhattanPt are constructors
    4. Constructor is used to create a new instance of a class.

        new CartesianPt(2, 3) => x --> 2
                                 y --> 3

    5. When a class contains no new fields, a default constructor is added.
    6. new Point() is not possible because abstract class is incomplete by default
